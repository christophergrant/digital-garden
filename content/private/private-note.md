Hello colleagues,

I have recently started a blog that will dive into
- Professional and technical topics, mostly about Apache Spark and Linux Foundation Delta Lake, in an effort to give back to the community.
- Non-professional interests of mine including art, social theory, and local-first software.

I'm also thinking of releasing companion videos either on LinkedIn or Youtube, as videos are easy to digest, and we live in a post-literate society.

I hope someone out there finds value from this content. 

Feel free to reach out to me directly here on LinkedIn, on Github, or via email. I greatly appreciate feedback.

Thanks,
Chris

DECIDED TO NOT POST THIS - it's too aggrandizing. The question is, how do I generate hits?
