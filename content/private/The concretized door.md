Imagine a doorframe. The doorframe stands on its own, surrounded by nothing. You find it to be beautiful and inviting. You're not really sure what lies behind it, but you want to pass through and experience what's on the other side.

But once you open that door, you are greeted with a solid wall of cold, hard concrete. 

This is a bit shocking, and your thoughts start racing:
* Why is this concrete here?
* Is it my fault that the concrete is here? Could I have done something differently in the past to not have experienced this concrete restriction?
* And finally, how thick is the concrete? Could I bust through it to experience the other side?

## Historical analysis - why is the concrete here?

The answer to the first question, if you can even accurately obtain it, is usually a long story - and to be honest, historical stuff like this usually bores me. So Iet's discuss the latter two points.

## Playing the blame game - is this my fault?

You think to yourself: has the concrete always been here, like this, for me? Could I have conducted myself differently and received a different outcome? 

What If I spent more time contemplating the beauty of the door? What If I had a slightly gentler grasp when I opened the door? What if I was having a bad hair day that I opened the door: would that have made a difference? 

Or more deeply, maybe this door has so much concrete behind it not for reasons that I can control, but something I cannot. Maybe the door is racist. Maybe it's sexist. 

In other words, maybe it's not **what** you've done, but **who** you are. But the lines between what we've done and who we are aren't always clear. Who we are has a strong effect on what we've done.

## Breaking down barriers - can I bust through the concrete?

The concrete is there. But you very much desire to break through this concrete and get to the other side.

The problems are:
* You're unsure how thick the concrete is. It could be entirely possible that it's very thin concrete. But it's also possible that the concrete is infinitely thick, and that no matter how much effort you put in, you're wasting your time.
* Let's say you do manage to break through the concrete with your impressive willpower. 
	* Would it be worth it? What if your expectations of the inner-door experience let you down? This question applies even if the concrete isn't there - but in this instance it is. Does working through the concrete devalue the inner-door experience?
	* Would you feel dirty for having gone through the entire process? What if you know that others have passed through that same door, but experienced no concrete resistance. 

`< !-- Hello, clever reader. I'll spoil it here. The door represents opportunities: they could be jobs, relationships, or any relation, really. The concrete represents a barrier that we as subjects are (probably mostly) powerless to address. Thanks, Madison. --/>`
