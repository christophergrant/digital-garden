## About this blog

This blog will focus on a few topics, including professional and technical topics like Apache Spark and Linux Foundation Delta Lake, as well as non-professional topics that I am interested in, including art, social theory, and local-first software.

This blog is living and breathing, and I reserve the right to edit/take down content as I see fit. Posts being completely retooled is not out of the question.


## About Christopher Grant

For work, I am currently employed in the technical pre and post-sales function at Databricks. The title on my theoretical business card is `Senior Specialist Solutions Architect`, which is confusing, so here's what I actually do:
- Tuning customer queries - including non-trivial solutions like pre-aggregations before inequality joins and standard lakehouse stuff like compaction, data skipping via (dynamic) file/partition pruning, and custom Spark-based configurations for optimal efficiency and cost savings.
- Architecting production-ready, advanced data pipelines, up to multi-Petabyte per-table scale.
- Teaching customers and internal resources about Delta Lake, Apache Spark, the Databricks platform, and more general Lakehouse architecture / basic distributed computing concepts.
- Mentoring/guiding internally on customer relationships, solving technical problems, and technical business presentations.
- Contributing to Open Source software.
- Customer/Product advocacy.


That being said, the job is fulfilling most of the time and I mostly recommend working at Databricks. If this sounds interesting to you and you'd like to explore similar roles at Databricks, please feel free to reach out to me via official channels (see LinkedIn below).

Work admittedly takes up a good amount of my time and energy, but outside of it I enjoy [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdmbbiMRe48), [movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/), and social theory.

I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area. In my opinion, it's great up here  - despite the issues you might hear about.

Please feel free to reach out! About anything! Online contacts are just as important as those offline.

## Other cool content

I really like [Pradyun Gedam](https://pradyunsg.me/blog) content about Python, development, accessibility, and their general philosophy about open source software. Their blog is somewhat of an inspiration to this one.

[PlasticPills](https://www.youtube.com/@PlasticPills/videos) is absolutely amazing. They bring the HEAT when it comes to philosophy and social theory with dazzling visuals that help laymen like myself understand complex theoretical concepts from challenging writers like Deleuze, Baurdrillard, Debord, Lacan, and Marx. Check out 
* [How Advertising Affects Your Unconscious | Anti-Oedipus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApF23AP5HO8) 
* [How Capitalism Really Started | Machine God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYYG08R1bRM)
* [The Culture Industry - Adorno, Horkheimer, Neomarxism and Ideology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQeHs4YVeug). 
One of these days I'm going to steal this style for distributed computing concepts.

I also very much enjoy [Jonas ƒåeika](https://www.youtube.com/@jonasceikaCCK/videos)'s work, which focuses on the connection of pop culture (mostly North American) to philosophical and social theorerical concepts. Bangers include
* [American Psycho, Baudrillard and the Postmodern Condition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJfurfb5_kw)
* [The Late Capitalism of K-Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8LxORztUWY)
* [Shrek (2001) - A Marxist analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWbaUnbo-_c)
