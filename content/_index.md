## About this blog

This blog will focus on a few topics, including professional and technical topics like Apache Spark and Linux Foundation Delta Lake, as well as non-professional topics that I am interested in, including art, social theory, and local-first software.

This blog is living and breathing, and I reserve the right to edit/take down content as I see fit. Posts being completely retooled is not out of the question.


## About Christopher Grant

For work, I am currently employed in the technical pre and post-sales function at Databricks. The title on my theoretical business card is `Senior Specialist Solutions Architect`, which is sometimes confusing so here's what I actually do:
- Tuning customer queries - including non-trivial solutions like pre-aggregations before an inequality join and standard lakehouse stuff like compaction, data skipping via (dynamic) file/partition pruning.
- Helping architect production-ready data pipelines, up to multi-Petabyte scale.
- Teaching customers and internal resources about Delta Lake, Apache Spark, the Databricks platform, and more general Lakehouse architecture / basic distributed computing concepts.
- Contributing to Open Source software.
- Customer/Product advocacy.
- Mentoring/guiding internally on customer relationships, solving technical problems, and business presentations.

That being said, the job is fulfilling most of the time and I mostly recommend working at Databricks.

Work admittedly takes up a good amount of my time and energy, but outside of it I enjoy [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdmbbiMRe48), [movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/), and social theory.

I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's pretty great up here despite the issues you might hear about.

Please feel free to reach out! About anything! Online contacts are just as important as those offline.
