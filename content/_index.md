## About this blog

This blog will focus on a few topics, including professional and technical topics like Apache Spark and Linux Foundation Delta Lake, as well as non-professional topics that I am interested in, including art, social theory, and local-first software.


## About Christopher Grant

For work, I am currently employed in the technical pre and post-sales function at Databricks. The title on my theoretical business card is `Senior Specialist Solutions Architect`, which is a mouthful, nonsense title that no-one understands, so I'll give a brief summary of what I do: 
- On good days, I'm [[tuning queries]], helping architect production-ready data pipelines, or contributing to [[Open Source]] software.
- On bad days, I'm relegated to being a human search engine who dredges up links to publicly available documentation. 
- That being said, the job is fulfilling most of the time and I mostly recommend working at Databricks.

Work admittedly takes up a good amount of my time and energy, but outside of it I enjoy [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdmbbiMRe48), [movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/), and social theory.

I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area.
