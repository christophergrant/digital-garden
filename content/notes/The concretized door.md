## Intro

Imagine a doorframe. The doorframe stands on its own, surrounded by nothing. You find it to be beautiful and inviting. You're not really sure what lies behind it, but you want to pass through and experience what's on the other side.

But once you open that door, you are greeted with a solid wall of cold, hard concrete. 

Something like this - but imagine it's concrete and the doorframe is way more enticing:

This is a bit shocking, and your thoughts start racing:
* Why is this concrete here?
* Is it my fault that the concrete is here? Could I have done something differently in the past to not have experienced this concrete restriction?
* And finally, how thick is the concrete? Could I bust through it to experience the other side?

## Historical analysis - why is the concrete here?

The answer to this question, if you can even accurately obtain it, is usually a long story - and to be honest, historical stuff like this usually bores me. 

So Iet's discuss the other two points.

## Playing the blame game - is this my fault?

You think to yourself: has the concrete always been here, like this, for me? Could I have conducted myself differently and received a different outcome? 

What If I spent more time contemplating the beauty of the door? What If I had a slightly gentler grasp when I opened the door? What if I was having a bad hair day that I opened the door: would that have made a difference? 

Or more deeply, maybe this door has so much concrete behind it not for reasons that I can control, but something I cannot. In other words, maybe it's not **what** you've done, but **who** you are. But the lines between what we've done and who we are aren't always clear. Who we are often has a strong effect on what we've done.

Of course, this all presupposes that we're free people to begin with and that the concrete was not just "destined" to be there.

## Breaking down barriers - can I bust through the concrete?

The concrete is there. But you very much desire to break through this concrete and get to the other side.

(this is where the metaphor breaks down, but let's just go with it anyway)

The problems are:
* You're unsure how thick the concrete is. It could be entirely possible that it's very thin concrete. But it's also possible that the concrete is infinitely thick, and that no matter how much effort you put in, you'll never break through it.
* Perhaps you're a concrete pacifist. That all concrete is in place for a good reason, and it's not our place to interfere with whatever force put the concrete there in the first place.
* But let's say you have no problems busting concrete down - and you do manage to break through the concrete with sheer willpower.
	* What if your expectations of the inner-door experience let you down? Does working through the concrete devalue the inner-door experience?
	* Would you feel dirty for having gone through the entire process? What if you know that others have passed through that same door but experienced no concrete resistance?

## Closing

A lot of people are scared to open doors because they are afraid that they will be met with concrete.

In my opinion, we can probably minimize the concrete that we face in our lives by changing our behavior, but that people are complicated, and a lot of concrete will be there regardless of what you do.

The obvious answer: I personally will try and continue opening these doors - because although there is a lot of concrete out there, there are a lot of inner-door experiences that make life worth living. To find the ecstatic experiences, you have to face a lot of concrete.

The not-so-obvious answer that I've come up with post-production: it's good to come back to your concretized doors every once and again - especially if it makes you ask the above questions. Asking these questions remind you that not every inner-door needs to be experienced - and that you can't always get what you want. However painful that may be.
